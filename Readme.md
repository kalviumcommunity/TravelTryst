<h1>DBMS Project Proposal</h1>
<br>
<b>Project Idea</b>

<p>
We propose developing a fictional Hotel Management System that will empower users to efficiently manage various aspects of hotel operations, including guest reservations, room allocation, billing, and reporting. This system will enhance the overall guest experience, streamline administrative tasks, and improve decision-making for hotel management. We intend to implement this project using SQL as the database language, as mentioned earlier. However, we will tailor the database schema and functionalities to suit the hotel management context.</p>

<h2>Plan to Incorporate Concepts</h2>

To apply the principles of database management to this Hotel Management System, we can make the following adaptations:

<h3>Schema & ERD:</h3> Design a database schema with tables such as rooms, guests, reservations, billing, and staff. Utilize an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually represent the relationships between these entities.

<h3>Normalization:</h3> Implement normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy in the database schema, particularly in tables related to guests and reservations.

<h3>DDL Commands:</h3> Create, Alter, Drop: Utilize Data Definition Language (DDL) commands to create and modify the database schema, including tables and their attributes, tailored to the hotel management context.

<h3>DML Commands:</h3>Select, Insert, Update, Delete: Implement Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands for querying guest data, inserting new reservations and guest information, updating room details, and managing reservations.

<h3>Role-Based Access Control:</h3> Establish role-based access control to manage user permissions within the system. Roles like receptionist, guest, and administrator will have distinct privileges.

<h3>Advanced SQL Queries</h3> - Joins, Subqueries: Employ SQL joins to combine data from different hotel-related tables, facilitating complex data retrieval. Implement subqueries to enhance the efficiency and precision of data queries as needed.
